This repository provides datasets for visual localization, specifically created for an indoor visual positioning system with multi-view queries. These datasets are intended to support the development of visual localization algorithms.
You can download our datasets here.

## Dataset Description
There are two datasets, labeled 'ENG' and 'Church,' respectively. Each dataset contains two folders: 'Database' and 'Query.' The structure of the datasets is as follows:

### Database folder
  - alignments: The transformation matrix of the front-facing frame that captured the scanning trajectory. It is represented as a 1 by 16 array, where each set of four values corresponds to a column in a 4 by 4 matrix.
  - cutouts: The database contains images and depth data, organized by frame in folders named [frame.surface.-]. Each frame consists of three surfaces, labeled as follows: 0 for right, 1 for left, and 4 for front.
  - pcd: 3D point cloud data for the specified location 

### Query folder
  - multiple-image: The multi-view query images are each named in the format [frame.surface.jpg]. Each frame consists of four surfaces, labeled as follows: 0 for right, 1 for left, 4 for front, and 5 for rear.
  - ground_truth.txt: This file contains the 6-DoF ground truth poses for each query image. Each entry is formatted as [query name, position (x, y, z), quaternion (w, x, y, z)], where position (x, y, z) represents the translation vector (in meters) from the world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system, and quaternion (w, x, y, z) specifies the cameraâ€™s orientation relative to the world coordinate system as a unit quaternion.
